## [How Epos Now modernized their data platform by building an end-to-end data lake with the AWS Data Lab](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/how-epos-now-modernized-their-data-platform-by-building-an-end-to-end-data-lake-with-the-aws-data-lab/)

Epos Now revolutionized their data analytics capabilities, taking advantage of the breadth and depth of the AWS Cloud. Theyâ€™re now able to serve insights to internal business users, and scale their data platform in a reliable, performant, and cost-effective manner.

The AWS Data Lab engagement enabled Epos Now to move from idea to proof of concept in 3 days using several previously unfamiliar AWS analytics services, including AWS Glue, Amazon MSK, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon API Gateway.

Epos Now is currently in the process of implementing the full data lake architecture, with a rollout to customers planned for late 2022. Once live, they will deliver on their strategic goal to provide real-time transactional data and put insights directly in the hands of their merchants.
