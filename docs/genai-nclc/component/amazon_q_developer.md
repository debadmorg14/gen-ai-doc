# Amazon Q Developer

Amazon Q Developer harnesses cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate your software development lifecycle (SDLC). With deep understanding of your code and AWS resources, it streamlines research, design, coding, testing, debugging, troubleshooting, and modernization. Amazon Q is there to help wherever you need itâ€”in the AWS Management Console, integrated development environment (IDE), AWS documentation, and through Slack and Microsoft Teams.

[Amazon Q in Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) 

These are the feature of Amazon Q in Developer

- Amazon Q is available in the IDE with CodeWhisperer to help you supercharge your development. You can ask Amazon Q to explain program logic in an unfamiliar codebase, quickly identify and fix bugs, or generate functional tests.

- Amazon Q helps troubleshoot and fix errors in the console in seconds with expert guidance and actionable step-by-step solutions. When encountering an error in the console, you can ask Amazon Q to resolve it in a single step. Amazon Q will provide context on the likely cause of the error, and explicit steps to remediate it, all informed by AWS best practices.

- Amazon Q can help you upgrade your Java applications to the latest language version. Amazon Q can identify and update mandatory package dependencies and frameworks, update deprecated code, incorporate security best practices, and generate tests to validate the upgraded application will run.

- With Amazon Q generative SQL, you can simplify query authoring and increase your productivity by expressing queries in natural language and receiving SQL code recommendations right in the Amazon Redshift Query Editor. Amazon Q can analyze user intent, query patterns, and schema metadata within Amazon Redshift to deliver SQL queries, reducing the time required to derive actionable data insights.

- Amazon Q integrates with AWS Support, allowing you to seamlessly connect with Support agents from within the Amazon Q interface if additional assistance is required. AWS will honor the entitlements of your Support plan when using this integration.
