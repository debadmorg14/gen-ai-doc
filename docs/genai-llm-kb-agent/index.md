# Tools for LLM

This generally refers to a stack of technologies or components centered around Large Language Models (LLMs). This “stack” can include a wide range of technologies and methodologies aimed at leveraging the capabilities of LLMs (e.g., vector databases, embedding models, APIs, plugins, orchestration libraries like LangChain, guardrail tools, etc.).

## Contents [I will write more about these concepts in coming days]
