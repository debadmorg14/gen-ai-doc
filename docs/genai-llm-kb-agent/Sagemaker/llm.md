# Foundation Model Information 

Amazon SageMaker JumpStart offers state-of-the-art foundation models for use cases such as content writing, code generation, question answering, copywriting, summarization, classification, information retrieval, and more. Use JumpStart foundation models to build your own generative AI solutions and integrate custom solutions with additional SageMaker features. For more information, see Getting started with Amazon SageMaker JumpStart.

A foundation model is a large pre-trained model that is adaptable to many downstream tasks and often serves as the starting point for developing more specialized models. Examples of foundation models include LLaMa-2-7b, BLOOM 176B, FLAN-T5 XL, or GPT-J 6B, which are pre-trained on massive amounts of text data and can be fine-tuned for specific language tasks.

# Use Foundation Model in Sagemaker Studio
You can fine-tune, deploy, and evaluate both publicly available and proprietary JumpStart foundation models directly through the Amazon SageMaker [Studio UI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/jumpstart-foundation-models-use-studio-updated.html).
